             In 1912, in Altena Castle in Germany, Richard Schirrmann created the first permanent Jugendherberge or "Youth Hostel."[citation needed] These first youth hostels were an exponent of the vision of the German Youth Movement to let poor city youngsters breathe fresh air outdoors.
             The youths were supposed to manage the hostel themselves as much as possible, doing chores to keep the costs down and build character, and be physically active outdoors. Because of this, many youth hostels closed during the middle part of the day.

             <p>Hostels provide lower-priced, sociable accommodation where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available. In the 2010s, hostels often have wifi access.
                Hostels are often cheaper for both the operator and occupants than hotels; hostels may have long-term residents who they employ as desk agents or housekeeping staff in exchange for experience or discounted accommodation.
                In India, Pakistan and South Africa, hostel also refers to boarding schools or student dormitories in resident colleges and universities. In other parts of the world, the word hostel mainly refers to properties offering shared accommodation to travellersor backpackers.

                 There are several differences between hostels and hotels, including:
                  1.	Hostels tend to be budget-oriented; rates are considerably lower, and many hostels have programs to share books, DVDs and other items.
                  2.	Hostels tend to have bunk beds or single beds in a shared room, rather than private rooms.
                  3.	For those who prefer an informal environment, hostels do not usually have the same level of formality as hotels.
                  4.	For those who prefer to socialize with their fellow guests, hostels usually have more common areas and opportunities to socialize. The dormitory aspect of hostels also increases the social factor.
                  5.	Hostels are generally self-catering, with a shared kitchen that all the guests use to make their food.
                  6.	Hostels normally close during the day to keep down cost (for the customer and the hostel).
                  7.	Hostels typically lack the extra amenities provided in hotel rooms (irons, hair dryers, coffeemakers, in-room TV with cable channels).
